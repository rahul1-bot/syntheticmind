    1. SyntheticMind is maintained as Rahul's private machine-learning control layer for study, research, experimentation, and creative enjoyment.
    2. The architecture is valuable because it exposes the complete workflow rather than hiding consequential behavior behind a framework boundary.
    3. That control is useful only when the behavior is correct. The current implementation is incomplete and must be hardened before capability expansion or any release discussion.
    4. Review decisions must favor deterministic execution, explicit state transitions, recoverable checkpoints, correct optimization accounting, and narrow interfaces over cosmetic parity with larger frameworks.
    5. The public API must speak established machine-learning language. Internally invented aliases for standard concepts are prohibited unless a real semantic distinction requires them.

    1. The stable baseline and all root ledgers are retained on `main` and `origin/main`.
    2. Active implementation work occurs on `dev` and is published to `origin/dev` after every completed development commit.
    3. A commit is not operationally complete while local `dev` and `origin/dev` differ.
    4. Promotion from `dev` to `main` requires an explicit stabilization decision supported by relevant verification.
    5. The repository remains private because it is personal research and study infrastructure, not a public framework release.
