    1. SyntheticMind is maintained as Rahul's private machine-learning control layer for study, research, experimentation, and creative enjoyment.
    2. The architecture is valuable because it exposes the complete workflow rather than hiding consequential behavior behind a framework boundary.
    3. That control is useful only when the behavior is correct. The current implementation is incomplete and must be hardened before capability expansion or any release discussion.
    4. Review decisions must favor deterministic execution, explicit state transitions, recoverable checkpoints, correct optimization accounting, and truthful interfaces while progressing toward full user-facing PyTorch Lightning capability parity.
    5. The public API must speak established machine-learning language. Internally invented aliases for standard concepts are prohibited unless a real semantic distinction requires them.

    1. The stable baseline and all root ledgers are retained on `main` and `origin/main`.
    2. Active implementation work occurs on `dev` and is published to `origin/dev` after every completed development commit.
    3. A commit is not operationally complete while local `dev` and `origin/dev` differ.
    4. Promotion from `dev` to `main` requires an explicit stabilization decision supported by relevant verification.
    5. The repository remains private because it is personal research and study infrastructure, not a public framework release.

| Strategic Note | Capability Parity and Ordered Hardening | Date: 19 August 2026 | Time: 05:19 AM | Name: Ghost |

    1. SyntheticMind's end state is full user-facing capability parity with core PyTorch Lightning, with Fabric excluded from the current boundary and public documentation, release work, and upstream test-suite porting deferred.
    2. Established machine-learning variable names, method names, parameter contracts, state meanings, and inherited extension hooks are compatibility requirements rather than cosmetic preferences.
    3. SyntheticMind will preserve its own internal architecture and apply the generic Python guidelines while matching the external semantics that machine-learning practitioners already understand.
    4. Exceptions require genuinely different semantics or algorithms and an explicit rationale; private terminology must never disguise an established concept.
    5. Hardening proceeds sequentially from architecture and issue inventories through foundational runtime layers. No isolated feature will be inserted into the middle of an unmapped execution path.
    6. Existing code comments remain in place, and new source-code comments are deferred during the current phase.
